		</td>
        <td align="top">
			<p>
				Support has been increased for various server runtime types. 
				First, a bare-minumum of support has been guaranteed for 
				any PRODUCTS which will be based on JBoss AS 7.2. This ensures
				that we should (hopefully) never have a situation where a new product
				release for JBoss EAP, SOA-P, or any other new or unannounced product 
				requires a corresponding release of tools to get a server started from within eclipse. 
				Extended support may be added in future JBossTools versions for these runtimes, but a situation
				where servers completely fail should now be a thing of the past.
				The new runtime will at least be recognized as its base underlying server type, 
				and, if the new runtime type follows typical conventions, it should be able to start, stop, and deploy, without any issues. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, support for previous and current versions of Gate-In have been added. 
				This ensures that Gate-In receives the same level of support that you've come to 
				expect from our other server adapters. Specifically, support for Gate-In servers versions 3.3.0 , 3.4.0, and 3.5.0 has been added and tested.
