			<p>

				In past releases, whenever an application server is started, JBoss Tools automatically
				adds relevant deployment scanners to your server, so that deployments to custom locations
				will be picked up by the server without any problems. Depending on your application server
				version, these scanners may be persisted across future restarts, or may not be. On servers
				where they are persisted, we also typically remove these scanners, to prevent multiple
				workspaces using the same server from having collisions or conflicting deployment locations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some users prefer to manage their deployment scanners on their own, and wish JBoss Tools did not
				automatically take control of this aspect of their development environment. For these users, 
				two new settings have been added to the server editor which will allow control for this behavior.

				There are two steps to any deployment process. The first is moving a deployable unit over to the server,
				and the second is letting the server recognize, load, and run the unit. A deployable
				such as a 'war' file, may be physically placed on a running application server, but may not be 'running'. 
				In this case, depending on what user interface you are looking at, you will get
				various terms to describe the situation. The JBoss Application Server has no official terminology
				for a deployable unit that is present but not running. Console output will only indicate that a module
				is "deployed" when it is both on the server and in the running state, or "undeployed" for when 
				it is not in the running state, regardless of whether the module is physically present on disk. 
			</p>
			<p>	The JBoss Administration Console, on the other hand, will use the terms "Add" or "Remove" to describe the act
				of physically placing a module inside an application server's directory structure. They will similarly use the terms
				"Enable" or "Disable" to describe the acts of moving them to the running state, or to the stopped state.</p>
			<p>	Eclipse, and therefore JBossTools, have yet another set of terms. The act of "Adding" or "Removing" a module
				only indicates how the module is recognized *inside* eclipse. Only a "publish" operation will either add or remove
				a module to or from a server's physical filesystem. And rather than "enable" or "disable", as the Administrative Console
				uses, Eclipse chooses "Start" or "Stop" to describe the act of moving a module to a running state, or to a not-running state
				respectively. </p>

			<p>
				Despite these overloaded terms, JBoss Tools is forced to align itself with the terminology of
				Eclipse WebTools, but chooses behavior that directly maps to that of the Administrative Console. 
				The 'stop' action, when used to stop a running module, can be accessed by 
				right-clicking on a module in the server view and selecting 'stop'. This action will move a deployment
				from the running state into a non-running state, but will NOT remove the module from the server's directory structure. 
				This behavior mimics the "Enable" action in the Administrative Console web UI. 
				This is in stark contrast to previous behavior, when the 'stop' action would also fully delete the module from 
				the Application Server's directory structure. </p>
			<p>	Similarly, using the 'start' action when right-clicking on a module in the Servers View, will not re-package and publish
				a project and transfer it to the servers directory structure. Instead, it will ONLY communicate to the server that it should
				now move the existing module from the stopped state into the running state.</p>
			<p>	There is no loss of functionality, though. Users who were used to the 'restart' action on a module in the Servers View 
				performing all steps including packaging, transfer, and moving the module into the running state, may instead use the 
				long-standing action "Full Publish", which has always been around to ensure a full and clean publish may be had for a 
				fresh and up-to-date deployment. </p>
