			<p>

				In past releases, whenever an application server is started, JBoss Tools automatically
				adds relevant deployment scanners to your server, so that deployments to custom locations
				will be picked up by the server without any problems. Depending on your application server
				version, these scanners may be persisted across future restarts, or may not be. On servers
				where they are persisted, we also typically remove these scanners, to prevent multiple
				workspaces using the same server from having collisions or conflicting deployment locations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some users prefer to manage their deployment scanners on their own, and wish JBoss Tools did not
				automatically take control of this aspect of their development environment. For these users, 
				two new settings have been added to the server editor which will suppress this behavior.

			<p>
				Modules may be published to a server, but may also be stopped at the same time. 
				You can see this behavior in your Administrative Console. Functionally, the difference
				between an undeploy and a stop is simply that during a stop, 
				the module will remain in the server's deployment
				folder, but the server is instructed to undeploy it. These changes align the behavior
				of JBoss Tools with that of the Administrative Console, and will help to remove confusion
				over what the actions are actually doing.
