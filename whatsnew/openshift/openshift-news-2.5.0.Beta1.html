			<td valign="top" align="left">
				To create or import an OpenShift application in JBoss Tools you launch the application wizard that does all 
				the heavy lifting for you. This wizard creates the application and imports it to a new project or merges it into 
				an existing one. To then publish these changes to OpenShift, you get over to the 
				server adapter and tell it to publish your Eclipse project. <br>
				In Alpha2 you had to think about publishing and manually trigger the adapter once you had run through the wizard. 
				Beta1 now prompts you right away and asks you if you want to push once the import/merge is done.

			<td valign="top" align="left">
				JBoss Tools offers you a server adapter to publish your local changes to OpenShift. This adapter does all
				git pushing for you. In case of maven projects publishing will usually trigger a maven build on OpenShift. 
				This may therefore take quite some time. In Alpha2 you had to wait for this to complete in order to 
				see the results. A limitation in Eclipse EGit prevented us from showing you the output while it was occurring.<br> 
				We improved EGit/JGit and contributed this enhancement to Eclipse. We are therefore now able to give you 
				immediate feedback while we push to OpenShift.

				If you want to deploy some binary artifact (ex. your application war) in JBoss Tools you simply drag and drop 
				your Eclipse project to the OpenShift server adapter. The adapter will then war and push it to OpenShift. 
				While this worked fine with JBoss AS and EAP, things didn't work out of the box for tomcat 6 and 7. 
				We now fixed this for Beta1.

				<br>To make your experience even smoother in case it still fails we now offer you a link to the environments variables
