		You can install JBoss&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Studio, packaged with Eclipse and dependent third party plug-ins, with a universal installer for all operating systems. The installer is provided in a <filename>.jar</filename> file and is available from the Customer Service Portal. The source code is available for inspection as a <filename>.zip</filename> file at the same location.

		Alternatively, if you already have Eclipse on your system you may prefer to use JBoss&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Studio BYOE. You install JBoss&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Studio from Eclipse Marketplace with this option.
