== About JBoss Server Tools

JBoss Server Tools is tooling for working with application servers in
the IDE. It extends and enhances the existing server functionality of
the IDE.

JBoss Server Tools consists of wizards, editors and actions that enable
you to define, configure and manage application servers.

Runtime detection is available to assist you in locating installed
application servers and integrating them into the IDE ready for use.
Additionally, you can define remote servers for JBoss community
application servers in the enhanced New Server wizard, which integrates
with the IDE Remote System Explorer (RSE) tool.JBoss Server Tools also
allows you to download JBoss community application servers from within
the IDE.

Extensions to the standard IDE New Server wizard and Server Editor allow
you to specify and customize more management and behavior settings for
servers. Settings include IDE interaction with servers such as
launching, communicating and publishing. The JBoss Server Editor
supports you to manage server settings for global and individual
application deployment.

JBoss Server Tools actions enable you to make customizations based on
application server type, such as default filesets added to new servers
and classpath filesets. You can also customize the default server used
for IDE actions such as 'Run on Server'.

[[about-ide-server-definitions]]
== About IDE Server Definitions

A server definition is a description of how the IDE is to use an
application server. It informs the IDE of configuration information with
which to start, communicate and manage an application server, including
application deployment. As such, a server definition is an essential
element for working with an application server in the IDE.

A complete server definition is composed of two items, as listed here.

Server runtime environment::
  This informs the IDE about available local application servers. Each
  server runtime environment defines a specific application server
  configuration in terms of the application server itself, a
  configuration file and a Java developer kit. By varying the
  configuration details, one application server can be associated with
  several server runtime environments.
Server adapter::
  This informs the IDE about management settings for server runtime
  environments. Each server adapter, also referred to as simply a
  server, completes the definition for a specific server by detailing
  settings such as access parameters, launch arguments, and publishing
  options. By varying the configuration details, one server runtime
  environment can have several server adapters associated with it.

You must generate at least one complete server definition for an
application server before you can use it in the IDE. To assist you with
this, JBoss Server Tools provides runtime detection that automatically
generates a complete default server definition for any installed
application servers found in a given local system search path.

= Features of JBoss Server Tools

[[features-overview]]
== Features Overview

The aim of this section is to guide you in using JBoss Server Tools:

1.  Download JBoss community application servers from with the IDE
2.  Use runtime detection to locate installed application servers and
generate complete server definitions, making them ready for IDE use
3.  Define custom configured servers, both local and remote, by creating
additional runtime environments and server adapters
4.  Manage server configuration and specify IDE-server interaction with
the JBoss Server Editor, including settings such as launch options,
publishing frequency and communication ports

[[download-a-jboss-community-application-server]]
== Download a JBoss Community Application Server

Application servers must be installed on your system in order to deploy
applications to local and remote instances of them. Many application
servers must be downloaded from outside the IDE. But JBoss Server Tools
can assist you to download JBoss community application servers from
within the IDE, as detailed in the procedure below.

1.  Click `Window`→`Preferences`, expand `JBoss Tools` and select
`JBoss Runtime Detection`.

progress bar and `Download` window show the progress of the download
process. You can click `Run in Background` to close the download window
and continue the download process.
9.  Click `OK` to close the `Preferences` window.

Once downloading is complete, the application server archive is
extracted and several automated actions occur:

1.  The path of the application server is added to the runtime detection
`Paths` table.
2.  A default server runtime environment is generated for the
application server.
3.  A default server adapter is created for the server runtime
environment.

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can download and install JBoss community application
servers when adding server runtime environments within `Preferences`
under `Server`→`Runtime Environments`, with the wizard for creating new
servers, or with the `Start from scratch` and `Start from a sample`
wizards in JBoss Central.

[[create-a-default-local-server-definition-with-runtime-detection]]
== Create a Default Local Server Definition with Runtime Detection

Before the IDE can use an application sever, you must create a server
definition for it. JBoss Server Tools provides runtime detection that
automatically generates a complete default server definition for any
installed application servers found in a given local system search path,
as detailed in the procedure below. Note that complete server
definitions are also automatically generated for JBoss community servers
downloaded with JBoss Server Tools.

1.  Click `Window`→`Preferences`, expand `JBoss Tools` and select
`JBoss Runtime Detection`.
+
image:images/4035.png[Click `Window`→`Preferences`, expand `JBoss Tools`

2.  Click `Add`.
3.  Select a path from which recursive scanning for application servers
is to commence. To detect a specific application server, select the
install directory for that application server. To detect multiple
application servers, select a directory higher up the directory tree.
4.  Depending on the outcome of the scan, follow the appropriate step:
+
If no new application servers are found or if new application servers
are found but you do not want to create any server runtime environments
for them, click `Cancel`.
+
If new application servers are found and you want to generate server
runtime environments for them, select the check boxes of the appropriate
application servers and click `OK`.
+
image:images/4289.png[If new application servers are found and you want
to generate server runtime environments for them, select the check boxes
of the appropriate application servers and click `OK`.]
+
In all cases, the path is added to the `Paths` table.
5.  Click `Apply` and click `OK` to close the `Preferences` window.

Generated server runtime environments are listed in `Preferences` under
`Server`→`Runtime Environments`. A default server adapter is
automatically created for each generated server runtime environment to
complete the server definition. Server adapters are listed in the
`Servers` view.

image:images/4290.png[A default server adapter is automatically created
for each generated server runtime environment to complete the server
definition. Server adapters are listed in the `Servers` view.]

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can manually define servers by using the IDE server
functions to create a server runtime environment and then to create a
server adapter.
====

[[create-an-additional-server-runtime-environment]]
== Create an Additional Server Runtime Environment

Runtime detection creates a server runtime environment as part of the
default server definition for each application server it discovers in
given search paths on your system. But you may want to create additional
server runtime environments that specify a variety of JREs or
configuration files for a given installed application server. The
procedure below details the process for creating new server runtime
environments. For older versions of application servers, you can also
create a new runtime server by cloning an existing one as explained
below.

1.  Click `Window`→`Preferences`, expand `Server` and select
`Runtime Environments`.

`Start from scratch` and `Start from a sample` wizards in
`JBoss Central`.
====

[[define-an-additional-local-server]]
== Define an Additional Local Server

Runtime detection defines a local server as part of the default server
definition for each application server it discovers in given search
paths on your system. But you may want to create additional server
adapters that have different configurations for a given server runtime
environment in order to define multiple servers. To create a new server
adapter to define a local server, you must use the new server wizard as
detailed in the procedure below.

1.  Click the `Servers` view. If the `Servers` view is not visible,
click `Window`→`Show View`→`Servers`.
2.  Depending on the number of existing servers, follow the appropriate
step:
+
If there are no existing servers, click
`Click this link to create a new server`.
+
If there are one or more existing servers, right-click an existing
server and click `New`→`Server`.
3.  Complete the fields and options as detailed:
1.  From the `Select the server type` list, select a JBoss community
application server.
2.  The `Server's host name` and `Server name` fields are completed by
default. In the `Server name` field, you can type a custom name by which
to identify the server in the `Servers` view.
3.  From the `Server runtime environment` list, select an existing
server runtime environment for the application server type.
Alternatively, to create a new runtime environment click `Add` and
complete the fields and options as appropriate.
+
image:images/4029.png[From the `Select the server type` list, select a

environment for the application server type to use. Alternatively, to
create a new runtime environment click `Add` and complete the fields and
options as appropriate.]
+
[NOTE]
====
If the `Server runtime environment` field is not shown, no server
runtime environments exist for the selected application server type. A
server runtime environment must be selected before you can successfully
create a server adapter and complete the server definition. To create a
new server runtime environment without canceling the wizard, click
`Next` and complete the fields and options as appropriate.
====
4.  Click `Next`.
5.  The server behavior options displayed vary depending on the selected
application server type. Complete the fields and options as detailed:
1.  To specify that the server life cycle will be managed from outside
the IDE, select the `Server is externally managed` check box.
2.  To specify that the server should be launched to respond to requests
on all hostnames, select the
`Listen on all interfaces to allow remote web connections` check box.
This option adds the `-b 0.0.0.0` argument to the server launch command.
3.  From the location list, select `Local`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `Expose your management port as the server's hostname` option, which
enables management commands sent by the IDE to be successfully received
by the server, is bypassed for local servers regardless of whether the
check box is selected.
====
+
image:images/4030.png[The server behavior options displayed vary

8.  Click `Finish` to create the server. The server is listed in the
`Servers` view, with the information in brackets detailing the server
status.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can create multiple servers that use the same application server.
But a warning is displayed if you try to simultaneously run more than
one server on the same host. This is because multiple running servers on
the same host can result in port conflicts.
====

[[define-a-remote-server]]
== Define a Remote Server

You can define remote servers for JBoss community application servers.
To complete a server definition, you must create a server adapter, or
server, that informs the IDE how to communicate and manage the remote
server, as detailed in the procedure below.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A complete server definition requires a server runtime environment and a
server adapter. Ideally the server runtime environment would be created
by specifying the remote application server and remote Java developer
kit but server runtime environments can only be created using local
components. To work around this issue, you must have a version of the
remote application server and remote Java developer kit installed
locally and create a server runtime environment based on these.
====

1.  Click the `Servers` view. If the `Servers` view is not visible,
click `Window`→`Show View`→`Servers`.
2.  Depending on the number of existing servers, follow the appropriate

[[manage-server-settings]]
== Manage Server Settings

JBoss Server Tools provides the JBoss Server Editor for managing the
settings of servers. This editor has two tabs: Overview and Deployment.
As described below, each tab enables you to configure fundamental server
settings.

The `Overview` tab details the settings for the server. Within this tab
you can provide management information, specify application publishing
and reload behavior, and customize port settings.

image:images/4036.png[The `Overview` tab details the settings for the
server. Within this tab you can provide management information, specify

To open the JBoss Server Editor for a specific server, in the `Servers`
view double-click the server. All changes to the settings of a server
must be saved before the results will take effect. To save changes made
to server settings in the JBoss Server Editor, press Ctrl+S. You may be
required to enter the server management password when making changes to
certain settings.

[[manage-server-settings-in-the-overview-tab]]
=== Manage Server Settings in the Overview Tab

The Overview tab of the JBoss Server Editor enables you to vary the
management and behavior settings of an individual server. Each section
of the Overview tab is outlined below. All changes to server settings
must be saved before the results will take effect. To save, press
Ctrl+S.

General information::

  To specify that the server should be launched to respond to requests
  on all hostnames, select the
  `Listen on all interfaces to allow remote web connections` check box.
  This option is most useful for remote servers and adds the
  `-b 0.0.0.0` argument to the server launch command.
+
  To enable management commands sent by the IDE to be successfully
  received by the server, select the
  `Expose your management port as the server's hostname` check box. This
  option is useful for remote servers and unnecessary for local servers.
+
[WARNING]
====
The `Expose your management port as the server's hostname` feature
should be used carefully for servers on production as it leaves the
server open for anyone to access.
====
+
  To specify the location of the server, from the list select `Local` or
  `Remote System Deployment`. For remote systems, there are further
  details that must be specified: the host, the path of the remote

Publishing::
This section details the publishing action the IDE should take in
response to modifications to local resources of deployed applications.
Publishing involves replacing changed project resources in the
dedicated deployment location of a server and the IDE action options
are `Never publish automatically`,
`Automatically publish when resources change`, and
`Automatically publish after a build event`. Additionally, you can
specify a minimum time interval that must occur between consecutive
automated publish actions by the IDE to control the frequency of
publishing.

Application reload behavior::
This section details the application reload action the IDE should take
in response to changed published resources of deployed applications.
Application reload involves undeploying and redeploying an application
and this action is necessary when you make changes to project
resources that will not be detected by the server. By default, the
application reload behavior is set to invoke application redeployment
when `.jar` files are changed.

By default, the application reload behavior is set to invoke
application redeployment when `.jar` files are changed.]
+
  To customize which changes invoke application redeployment, select the
  `Customize application reload behavior on changes to project resources`
  check box. In the `Force module restart on following regex pattern`
  field, type a regex pattern indicating the changed resources that you
  want to trigger redeployment.
+
  To disable application reload, select the
  `Customize application reload behavior on changes to project resources`
  check box and ensure the
  `Force module restart on following regex pattern` field is empty.
Server state detectors::
  This section specifies which method the IDE should use to verify the
  started and stopped status of the server.
+
image:images/4042.png[This section specifies which method the IDE
should use to verify the started and stopped status of the server.]
+
  There are four methods from which to choose:
+
  1.  `Web Port`, which pings the web port on the host to see if the
  server responds
  2.  `Timeout`, which waits for a specified time duration and then
  declares the start or stop operation a success without any actual
  verification
  3.  `Process Terminated` (available for Shutdown Poller of local
  servers only), which checks if a server process is still alive and
  sets the server status to stopped when it is terminated
  4.  `JMX`, which polls JMX, the JBoss Management service
+
  Note that server state detection options are disabled if the
  `Server is externally managed` check box under `Server Behavior` is
  selected.
Server ports::
  This section details the ports and port offset that the IDE should use
  for communication with the server.
+
image:images/4046.png[This section details the ports and port offset
that the IDE should use for communication with the server.]
+
  Port offset is typically offered by newer application servers and it
  enables multiple servers to run on the same system without port
  conflicts. JBoss Server Tools uses information in the server
  configuration file, typically XPath values, to automatically detect
  the correct ports and port offset for communicating with the server
  but you can perform further customization.
+
  To view the configuration file information used by JBoss Server Tools
  for automatic port detection, click `Configure` corresponding to the
  appropriate tool. The information used is displayed in the
  `Current Value` field. To change this value, click `Edit XPath`. Click
  `OK` to close the window.

=== Manage Server Settings in the Deployment Tab

The Deployment tab of the JBoss Server Editor enables you to vary the
deployment settings of an individual server. Each section of the
Deployment tab is outlined below. All changes to server settings must be
saved before the results will take effect. To save, press Ctrl+S.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing deployment settings when modules are already deployed can
adversely result in multiple deployed copies of an application. For this
reason, many of the functions of the Deployment tab are only enabled
when a server is fully synchronized and it has no modules deployed.

Default settings for the server::

  packaged.

kept and how they are packaged.]

  You can customize the deployment location and packaging type:
+
  1.  To select the workspace deployment folder for the server, click
  `Use workspace metadata`.
  2.  To select the deployment folder of the application server, click
  `Use the JBoss deploy folder`.
  3.  To select a folder of your choice, click
  `Use a custom deploy folder`. With this option, complete the
  `Deploy directories` and `Temporary Deploy Directory` fields. The
  temporary folder must be on the same file system as the final deploy
  location otherwise publishing often fails.
  4.  For all modules to be archived for deployment, select the
  `Deploy projects as compressed archives` check box. This avoids
  exploded deployments and reduces the amount of memory deployments
  occupy but may result in slower deployment.
Settings per module::
  This section shows deployment settings for all modules in the
  workspace regardless of whether they are deployed on the server under
  consideration.

modules in the workspace regardless of whether they are deployed on

+
  To filter the module list in the case that you have many modules, from
  the `Filter by` list select the criteria for the filter. If you select
  the `By Module Name` filter option, in the text field enter the part
  or whole name of the module.
+
  To change the `Deployment Location` and `Temporary Deploy Directory`
  on a per module basis, in the table click the value to be changed and
  enter an alternative value. Ensure the values for these variables are
  specified use absolute paths or paths relative to the default deploy
  directory.

[[customizing-overview]]
== Customizing Overview

The aim of this section is to guide you in customizing JBoss Server
Tools:

1.  Enable runtime detection to search paths for application servers on
IDE start
2.  Select a default server for IDE actions
3.  Specify default file sets that are listed in the `Servers` view for
ease of access
4.  Customize classpath entries for your projects based on application
server type

[[enable-runtime-detection-on-ide-start]]
== Enable Runtime Detection on IDE Start

You can customize runtime detection to automatically search paths for
installed application servers when the IDE starts. If any application
servers are found, you are prompted about creating corresponding
complete server definitions.

To enable automated searching on IDE start, click
`Window`→`Preferences`. Expand `JBoss Tools` and select
`JBoss Runtime Detection`. In the `Paths` table, select the
`Every start` check box for all of the paths that you want to be
automatically searched on IDE start. Click `Apply` and click `OK` to
close the Preferences window.

automatically searched on IDE start. Click `Apply` and click `OK` to
close the Preferences window.]

[[set-a-default-server]]
== Set a Default Server

JBoss Server Tools enables you to select a default server on which to
carry out actions such as `Run on server`. This is useful when you have
multiple server instances but use one predominately.

To set a default server, in the global toolbar of the JBoss perspective
click the `Select a default server` icon image:images/4057.png[image].
From the list of existing servers, click the server that you want to set
as the default. Alternatively, to create a new default server click
`New Server` and follow the instructions.

the JBoss perspective click the `Select a default server` icon. From the
list of existing servers, click the server that you want to set as the
default. Alternatively, to create a new default server click
`New Server` and follow the instructions.]

[[default-file-sets]]
== Default File Sets

File sets are collections of files that are listed under the server in
the `Servers` view for ease of access. JBoss Server Tools generates a
default file set for new JBoss community application servers that
includes the server configuration file. But JBoss Server Tools also
provides the ability for you to customize default file sets for
individual servers and application server types.

To customize the file set for an individual server, in the `Servers`
view expand the server. Right-click `Filesets` and click
`Create File Filter`. In the `Name` field, type a name for the filter.
In the `Root Directory` field, type the path of the directory in which
the filter is to be applied or click `Browse` to navigate to the
location. In the `Includes` and `Excludes` fields, type the regex
patterns for filtering. Click `OK` to create the filter. The new filter
is listed under the server in the `Servers` view and expanding the
filter shows all of the matching files.

image:images/4040.png[To customize the file set for an individual
server, in the `Servers` view expand the server. Right-click `Filesets`
and click `Create File Filter`.]

image:images/4039.png[In the `Name` field, type a name for the filter.
In the `Root Directory` field, type the path of the directory in which
the filter should be applied or click `Browse` to navigate to the
location. In the `Includes` and `Excludes` fields, type the regex
patterns for filtering. Click `OK` to create the filter.]

To customize the default file set for an application server type, click
`Window`→`Preferences`. Expand `Server` and select `Default Filesets`.
From the list, select a JBoss community application server type. Click
`Add` or click `Remove` to customize the default file sets. Click
`Apply` and click `OK` to close the Preferences window.

image:images/4005.png[To customize the default file set for an
application server type, click `Window`→`Preferences`. Expand `Server`
and select `Default Filesets`. From the list, select a JBoss community
application server type. Click `Add` or click `Remove` to customize the
default file sets. Click `Apply` and click `OK` to close the Preferences
window.]

[[default-classpath-entries]]
== Default Classpath Entries

Classpath entries specify the availability of `.jar` files for your
projects. JBoss Server Tools generates a default classpath file set for
new JBoss community application servers based on the `.jar` files that
accompany each. But JBoss Server Tools also provides the ability for you
to customize classpaths for individual servers and application server
types.

To customize the classpath file set for an application server type,
click `Window`→`Preferences`. Expand `Server`→`Runtime Environments` and
select `Default Classpath Entries`. From the
`Select classpath filesets for this runtime type` list, select a JBoss
community application server type. Click `Add` or click `Remove` to
customize the classpath file sets. Click `Apply` and click `OK` to close
the Preferences window.

image:images/4022.png[To customize the classpath file set for an
application server type, click `Window`→`Preferences`. Expand
`Server`→`Runtime Environments` and select `Default Classpath Entries`.
From the `Select classpath filesets for this runtime type` list, select
a JBoss community application server type. Click `Add` or click `Remove`
to customize the classpath file sets. Click `Apply` and click `OK` to
close the Preferences window.]
