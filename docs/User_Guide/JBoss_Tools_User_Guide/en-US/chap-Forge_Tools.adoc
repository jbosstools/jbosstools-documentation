= Overview of Forge Tools

== About Forge

Forge is an application for developing Java EE applications, promoting
ease in getting started, working efficiently, and integrating
technologies. It simplifies development workflow by providing automation
at a command line level. Such automation is useful if you are working
with new or complex technology or completing repetitive tasks.

Forge consists of a command line interface and sets of commands provided
through plug-ins. The Forge command line accepts standard UNIX commands
such as `cd` for change directory, `mkdir` to create a new directory and
`touch` to create a new file. But the real power of Forge lies in its
unique command set, which is extendable through plug-ins. For example,
the `scaffold` command generates a user interface for an application and
the `persistence` command adds persistence to a project. Furthermore,
Forge comprehends a range of file types, with actions for working with
their contents.

== About Forge Tools

Forge Tools is tooling that integrates Forge into the IDE. It enhances
your workflow by providing and integrating Forge functionality within
the IDE.

Forge Tools consists of the Forge Console and background actions. The
Forge Console provides a Forge command line on which to execute all of
the Forge commands. The background actions result in the outcome of the
Forge commands being immediately reflected in the IDE. For example,
files are opened in editors and projects and directories expanded in
explorer views as actions creating and modifying them are executed on
the Forge command line.

= Features of Forge Tools

== Features Overview

The aim of this section is to guide you in using Forge Tools:

* View and manage the Forge Console view, from which the Forge command
line is accessible
* Start and stop the Forge runtime server in order to access the command
line
* Navigate to project resources in the Forge command line
* Understand how Forge commands affect the IDE through background
actions, such as expanding directories in explorer views and opening
files in editors
* Use wizards for accomplishing common Forge commands as an alternative
to the Forge command line

== Manage the Forge Console

A key element for working with Forge is the Forge command line. In order
to see this, you need to open the Forge Console view.

image:images/4060.png[ To open the Forge Console view, click Window→Show
View→Other. Expand Forge and double-click Forge Console and click OK.
Alternatively, press Ctrl+4, at which you are prompted whether you also
want to start the Forge runtime server. Irrespective of your response to
starting Forge, the Forge Console view opens. ]

To open the Forge Console view, click Window→Show View→Other. Expand
Forge, select Forge Console and click OK. Alternatively, press Ctrl+4,
at which you are prompted whether you also want to start the Forge
runtime server. Irrespective of your response to starting Forge, the
Forge Console view opens.

== Manage the Forge Runtime Server

You must start a Forge runtime server in order to access the Forge
command line. Forge Tools provides actions for starting and managing the
Forge runtime server.

Start Forge::
  In the Forge Console view, click the Start the default Forge runtime
  icon image:images/4062.png[image]. Alternatively, press Ctrl+4 and at
  the prompt asking if you want to start the Forge runtime server, click
  Yes. A progress bar in the IDE window and text in the Forge Console
  view indicate the starting status of Forge.
  +
  image:images/4063.png[ In the Forge Console view, click the Start the
  default Forge runtime icon. Alternatively, press Ctrl+4 and at the
  prompt asking if you want to start the Forge runtime server, click
  Yes. ]
Run Forge in the background::
  With a running instance of Forge, in the Forge Console view click the
  Close icon image:images/4071.png[image]. Despite the Forge Console
  view not being open, Forge continues to run in the background. Reopen
  the Forge Console view to access the same Forge command line,
  identifiable by the existing command line output.
Stop Forge::
  In the Forge Console view, click the Stop the running Forge runtime
  icon image:images/4061.png[image]. Alternatively, on the Forge command
  line, enter `exit`.
  +

  `exit`. ]

== Navigate to Project Resources on the Forge Command Line

Forge Tools enables you to efficiently navigate to project resources,
such as directories and files, on the Forge command line.

To navigate to a project resource on the Forge command line, in the
Project Explorer view right-click any project resource and click Show
In→Forge Console. If the Forge runtime server is not started, you are
prompted to start it. At the prompt, click OK.

image:images/4064.png[ To navigate to a project resource on the Forge
command line, in the Project Explorer view right-click any project
resource and click Show In→Forge Console. ]

Alternatively, in the Project Explorer view, select a project resource
and click the Go to Selection icon image:images/4068.png[image] in the
Forge Console view.

Both of these actions result in the Forge command line automatically
executing the `pick-up` command for the project resource. Following
this, the command line navigates to the project resource, the command
line indicates the selected resource, and the resource opens in an
editor if it is a file.

the `pick-up` command for the project resource. ]

== Background Actions Invoked by Forge Commands

Forge Tools invokes background actions in the IDE in response to
commands issued on the command line in the Forge Console view. For
example, if you create a project file or directory on the Forge command
line, the Project Explorer view is automatically refreshed to show the
newly created project resource. A list of Forge commands that result in
additional background actions is given below.

`cd`::
  The command navigates to the project directory and selects it in the
  Project Explorer and Package Explorer views.
`pick-up`::
  The command navigates to the project resource and in the case that the
  resource is a file it is opened in an editor within the IDE. The
  project resource is selected and expanded in the Project Explorer and
  Package Explorer views. If the resource resides outside the workspace,
  it is selected and expanded in the Remote Systems Explorer view,
  providing this is installed.
`open`::
  The command opens a file in an editor within the IDE. The project
  resource is selected and expanded in the Project Explorer and Package
  Explorer views. If the resource resides outside the workspace, it is
  selected and expanded in the Remote Systems Explorer view, providing
  this is installed.
`new-project`::
  The command creates a new project in a specified location. The project
  is automatically imported into the workspace and it is visible in the
  Project Explorer and Package Explorer views.
`persistence setup`::
  The command creates a `persistence.xml` file. This file is selected in
  the Project Explorer and Package Explorer views and it is
  automatically opened in an editor within the IDE.
`entity`::
  The command creates a new entity and associated Java file. This file
  is selected in the Project Explorer and Package Explorer views and it
  is automatically opened in the Java editor within the IDE.
`field`::
  The command creates a new field for an entity. The Java file
  associated with the entity is selected in the Project Explorer and
  Package Explorer views and it is automatically opened in an editor
  within the IDE and the field selected. The field is also selected in
  the Outline view.

== Access a List of Forge Commands

Forge Tools provides access to a readily available list of Forge
commands. Additionally, the commands can be easily inserted in to the
Forge command line, as detailed below.

To view the list of Forge commands, with a running instance of Forge,
press Ctrl+4. To insert one of the commands in to the Forge command
line, in the pop-up window expand the command groups and double-click a
command.

groups and double-click a command. ]

== Use Forge Wizards

You may prefer to work with wizards rather than the command line. Forge
Tools provides wizards for some of the most used Forge commands, in
addition to supporting command line functionality. There are three
wizards currently available relating to entities, as detailed below.

Entities from Tables::
  This wizard generates entities from an existing database. There are
  options for creating a new project if one does not already exist and
  browsing for the driver.jar and driver classes.
REST Endpoints from Entities::
  This wizard generates REST endpoint for entities.
Scaffold UI from Entities::
  This wizard generates the necessary scaffolding for you to use JPA
  entities in your project. There are options for JavaServer Faces and
  AngularJS implementations, with the wizard creating the associated
  pages and Java backing beans.

To open a Forge Tools wizard, click File→New→Other and expand JBoss
Tools→Forge. Select one of the listed wizards, click Next and follow the
instructions. In the case that Forge is not already started, the wizard
automatically starts it.
