== About Mobile Web Tools

Mobile Web Tools provides tooling for developing mobile web applications
within the IDE. It simplifies the process of getting started with HTML5
and jQuery Mobile technologies that are used for these types of
applications and provides efficient workflows for developing with them
on a daily basis.

Mobile Web Tools consists of project wizards, file templates, the jQuery
Mobile palette, and actions for developing with HTML5 and jQuery Mobile:

1.  The HTML5 project wizards and HTML5 jQuery Mobile file template
enable you to quickly generate the foundations of mobile web
applications and to view mobile web application programming in action.
2.  The jQuery Mobile palette offers a visual reference of the available
HTML5 and jQuery Mobile user interface widgets, which can be
effortlessly inserted into your project files with drag-and-drop
functionality. In conjunction with the jQuery Mobile palette, widget
wizards allow you to easily customize HTML5 and jQuery Mobile widgets
when inserting them into your project.
3.  Code assistance and one-click action for viewing jQuery Mobile pages
in browsers enable you to work more efficiently when developing mobile
web applications in the IDE.

jQuery Mobile and HTML5 widgets to your project. The jQuery Mobile
palette, part of the `Palette` view, is available for use when working
with HTML5 files in the JBoss Tools HTML Editor.

image:images/4086.png[The jQuery Mobile palette is available in the
`Palette` view, which is part of the JBoss perspective.]

The jQuery Mobile palette is automatically displayed in the `Palette`
view when a HTML5 file is opened in the JBoss Tools HTML Editor. To open
a file in this editor, in the `Project Explorer` view right-click a
HTML5 file and click `Open With`→`JBoss Tools HTML Editor`.
Alternatively, if `JBoss Tools HTML Editor` is the default option for
`Open With`, double-click the HTML5 file to open it in the editor. The
file opens in the editor and the jQuery Mobile palette is displayed in
the `Palette` view.

[NOTE]
====
The `Palette` view must be visible in order to see the jQuery Mobile
palette. To open the view, click `Window`→`Show View`→`Other`, expand
`General` and double-click `Palette`.
====

To show or hide an individual palette in the `Palette` view, click the
name of the individual palette.

To search for a palette element within the jQuery Mobile palette, in the
search field type a search term or phrase. The elements displayed in the
jQuery Mobile palette are filtered as you type in the search field.

[[insert-a-jquery-mobile-palette-widget-into-a-html5-file]]
== Insert a jQuery Mobile Palette Widget into a HTML5 File

The jQuery Mobile palette contains wizards for the HTML5 and jQuery
Mobile user interface widgets commonly used in mobile web applications.
The widgets are grouped in the palette by functionality, with tooltips
providing widget descriptions.

To insert a palette widget in a file open in the JBoss Tools HTML
Editor, drag the widget icon to the appropriate place in the file.
Alternatively, ensure the text cursor is located at the desired
insertion point in the file and click the widget icon. For widgets with
no attributes that can be customized, such as `JS/CSS` and
`Field Container`, the code snippets are immediately inserted into the
file. For widgets with attributes that can be customized, a widget
wizard opens allowing you to input attribute information. Once you have
completed the customizable fields, click `Finish` and the code snippet
is inserted into the file.

The widget wizards have three common aspects:

Design fields::
  These fields are unique to each widget. They allow you to customize
  the attributes of the widget by providing names, actions, numbers of
  elements, and styling themes. All widget wizards assign automatically
  generated values to the `ID` attribute in the case that you do not
  specify a value. Content assist is available for the `URL (href)`
  field by placing the text cursor in the field and pressing Ctrl+Space.
Add references to JS/CSS::
  This check box provides the ability to automatically add any missing
  library references to the HTML5 file that are required by the widget.
Preview Panes::
  These panes show previews of the code snippet for the widget and of
  the rendered widget. The preview panes can be shown and hidden by
  clicking `Show Preview` and `Hide Preview`, respectively.
