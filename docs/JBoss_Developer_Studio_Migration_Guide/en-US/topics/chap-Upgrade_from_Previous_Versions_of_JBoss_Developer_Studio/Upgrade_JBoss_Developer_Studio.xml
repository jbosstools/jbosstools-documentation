	<title>Upgrade JBoss Developer Studio</title>
	<para>
		It is not possible to upgrade an existing JBoss&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Studio installation to JBoss&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Studio 7 because they are based on different versions of Eclipse. For example, JBoss&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Studio 6 is based on Eclipse Juno (4.2) but JBoss&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Studio 7 is based on Eclipse Kepler (4.3).
	</para>
	<para>
		To use JBoss&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Studio 7, you must download and run the universal installer available from the Customer Service Portal at <ulink url="https://access.redhat.com"/>.
	</para>

			You can use different versions of JBoss&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Studio alongside each other by installing them in different directories.
