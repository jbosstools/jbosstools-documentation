		<title>About BrowserSim</title>
	
		<para>BrowserSim is a mobile web browser simulator. It enables you to view and interact with web pages as they would appear on mobile devices.</para>
		
		<para>BrowserSim consists of an external web browser window. This browser window is different from standard browsers in that it can be transformed to simulate browsers on a variety of mobile devices. The browser window can also be rotated to demonstrate the changes that would occur to a web application as a result of rotating a mobile device. Additionally, BrowserSim provides access to tools for inspecting and editing the source of web pages.</para>

		<title>System Requirements</title>

		<para>The overall system requirements of JBoss Developer Studio are applicable for BrowserSim and can be viewed in the JBoss Developer Studio Installation Guide at <ulink url="https://access.redhat.com"/> on the Red Hat Customer Portal. But, as reiterated below, there are additional system requirements and restrictions when using BrowserSim on Microsoft Windows operating systems.</para>
	
		<para>BrowserSim depends on WebKit and, consequently, requires Apple Safari to be installed on Microsoft Windows operating systems. Only a 32-bit version of Apple Safari is available for Microsoft Windows operating systems. To work around this restriction, you must install a 32-bit version of Apple Safari and a 32-bit version of JBoss&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Studio on 32-bit and 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems.</para>
