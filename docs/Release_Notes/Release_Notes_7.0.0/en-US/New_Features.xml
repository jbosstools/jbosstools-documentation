			<term>Project Examples</term>
			<listitem><para>It is now possible to use the project examples offered in JBoss Central when offline. The examples and their dependencies can be pre-cached during an online session and then an offline mode can be enabled. Pre-caching and offline mode can be accessed in the IDE <guimenu>Preferences</guimenu>, under <guilabel>JBoss Tools</guilabel>&rarr;<guilabel>Project Examples</guilabel>.</para></listitem>

			<term>JBoss Server Tools</term>
			<listitem><para><remark>Wildfly?</remark></para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>-->
		<varlistentry>
			<term>Forge Tools</term>
			<listitem><para>The Forge wizards have been relocated and can now be found by clicking <guimenu>File</guimenu>&rarr;<guimenu>New</guimenu>&rarr;<guimenu>Other</guimenu> and expanding <guilabel>JBoss Tools</guilabel>&rarr;<guilabel>Forge</guilabel>. The <guilabel>Entities From Tables</guilabel> wizard now provides options to create a project if one does not already exist and browse for the driver JAR file and the driver classes. The <guilabel>Scaffold UI From Entities</guilabel> wizard has been simplified and now provides the option to choose between JavaServer Faces and AngularJS implementations. A new wizard has been introduced that generates REST endpoints for entities. Progress bars have been added to all of the wizards to indicate their progress.<!-- <remark>Forge 2?</remark>--></para></listitem>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Maven Tools</term>
			<listitem><para>More information is now provided about dependencies when a project is converted into a Maven project. After double-clicking a dependency to change the scope, non-default scopes and optional attributes for compile and runtime scopes are now explicitly displayed in the "Maven Dependency" column of the dependency identification page.</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>LiveReload Tools</term>
			<listitem><para>This feature is now available for deployed resources, as well as those in the workspace. Prompts have been introduced to assist in automatically creating and starting LiveReload servers as needed. The <filename>livereload.js</filename> script can be automatically injected into HTML pages, negating the need for LiveReload browser extensions. Additionally, you can experience applications using LiveReload on external devices with the <guilabel>Allow Remote Connections</guilabel> feature. In conjunction with this, LiveReload Tools has introduced a QR code that can be scanned in order to simplify viewing on external devices.</para></listitem>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Web Service Tools</term>
			<listitem><para>The WS Tester now has <guimenu>GET</guimenu> as the default test type, where previously it was JAX-WS. This is in alignment with the continuing promotion of RESTful services.</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>			
		<varlistentry>
			<term>BrowserSim</term>
			<listitem><para>The JVM with which to launch BrowserSim can now be specified in the IDE <guimenu>Preferences</guimenu>, under <guilabel>BrowserSim/CordovaSim</guilabel>. This enables BrowserSim to be run with 32-bit JVMs from within 64-bit JBoss Developer Studio installations on 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems, lifting the previous restriction. Note that 32-bit JVM choice is limited to 32-bit JRE6, JDK6, or JDK7 on Microsoft Windows operating systems. <remark>WHY?</remark></para></listitem>
