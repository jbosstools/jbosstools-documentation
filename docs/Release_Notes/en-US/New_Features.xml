	<title>New Features</title>

	<para>This release of JBoss Developer Studio includes new features to enhance and extend its functionality:</para>

	<variablelist>
		<title></title>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>Source Code</term>
			<listitem><para>The source code for JBoss Developer Studio has always been available from the Red Hat Customer Portal for inspection but additional steps have been taken so that you can now also build the source code into a working copy of JBoss Developer Studio.</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>	
		<varlistentry>
			<term>JBoss Central</term>
			<listitem><para>The JBoss Central tab has been given a new and improved appearance in order to provide you with a better user experience. Changes to the Getting Started page include project wizard descriptions when hovering on project icons, increased visibility of quickstart project wizards, links to the Ticket Monster tutorial by JBoss Developer Framework, aggregated blog and twitter feeds via JBoss Buzz, and links to resources such as documentation and forums. If you do not have the necessary plug-in installed to use a wizard, you will be prompted to install it when you select the wizard. Additionally, the available quickstart projects have been expanded to encompass Portal applications. The Software/Updates page continues to list available software and updates for the IDE and now includes OpenShift Tools.</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>				
		<varlistentry>
			<term>Project Examples</term>
			<listitem><para>You can use the new Show In&rarr;Cheat Sheets feature to open imported project cheat sheets in the Cheat Sheets tab. You can customize the automated opening behavior of cheat sheets in imported projects that have this facility in Preferences under JBoss Tools&rarr;Project Examples. In order to achieve the cheat sheet features, new context sensitive parameterized commands have been introduced that you can also incorporated into cheat sheets you create.</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>JBoss Server Tools</term>
			<listitem><para>Support has extended to AS 7.1 and its derived products. Support for previous and current versions of GateIn have been added, specifically versions 3.3.0, 3.4.0 and 3.5.0. You can now customize the behavior governing the addition and removal of deployment scanners to a server through the server editor. Additionally, start and stop actions for deployed modules have been implemented such that now stopped modules will be undeployed by the server but continue to reside in the deployment folder of the server. This behavior aligns with that of the administrative consoles of servers such as Red&nbsp;Hat&nbsp;JBoss&nbsp;Enterprise&nbsp;Application&nbsp;Platform.</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>Forge Tools</term>
			<listitem><para>The embedded Forge runtime server is now version 1.3.0.Final. Wizards are now provided for common Forge commands as a visual and guided alternative to the command line. The current wizards enable you to create entities and scaffold a JSF user interface from JPA entities. The range of wizards will be extended in future releases.</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>Maven Tools</term>
			<listitem><para>The JPA, JSF and JAX-RS configurators were contributed to the m2e-wtp project, at the Eclipse Foundation, so they are now available to Eclipse users in addition to JBoss Developer Studio users. While you could already add and remove the Maven repositories defined under profiles in your settings.xml file, you can now also edit existing profiles. Automatic downloading of missing JAR dependencies for Maven projects has been extended to all types of projects. As such, you are informed when a compatible source is found, downloaded sources are stored in your local Maven repository and you can automate source associations with the 'Remember my decision' feature.</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>LiveReload Tools</term>
			<listitem><para>This new tool implements LiveReload functionality in the IDE. LiveReload automatically refreshes web pages as changes to the source files are made and saved, removing the need to manually refresh web pages and improving the workflow for developers. LiveReload Tools can be used in conjunction with both local web application resources and those deployed on servers. Additionally, LiveReload Tools enables LiveReload for web pages viewed on remote devices and computers.</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>		
		<varlistentry>
			<term>JSF Tools</term>
			<listitem><para>JSF Tools ensures xmlns are automatically added to files when you insert a JSF component into a page with the code assist feature. This is possible because JSF Tools provides code assist for all components used in a project and not only those defined in the current page. Strict tag validation has been introduced which checks components and attributes used in XHTML pages against appropriate tag libraries. Tag validation is disabled by default but can be enabled in Preferences under JBoss Tools&rarr;Web&rarr;JSF&rarr;Validation.</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>CDI Tools</term>
			<listitem><para>In response to CDI validator warnings, the Quick Fix menu will assist in creating missing beans.xml files.</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>			
		<varlistentry>
			<term>BrowserSim</term>
			<listitem><para>iPad and iPad Mini skins have been added to the ever growing range of available simulated devices. FireBug Lite and Weinre have been integrated so that you can debug the source pages of your web applications with familiar tools. LiveReload is available on simulated devices so that open web pages are automatically updated as you change the source code. You can now take screen captures of simulated devices and their web pages and open multiple synchronized simulated devices showing the same web page but with different skins. LiveReload can be enabled on a per simulated device basis. </para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>jQuery Mobile Tools</term>
			<listitem><para>jQuery Mobile has been further integrated into the IDE, with drag-and-drop palette capabilities and a code completion feature. When dragging and dropping jQuery Mobile components from JBoss Palette into your HTML and HTML5 source code, corresponding wizards open to assist you in completing the attribute fields of the component and inserting JS and CSS references into source files when missing.</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>						
		<varlistentry>
			<term>OpenShift Tools</term>
			<listitem><para>New functionality includes the ability to restart applications deployed on OpenShift from within the IDE, actually restarting your OpenShift node and your application. Additionally, OpenShift Tools has been made smarter: you are automatically asked if you want to publish changes to OpenShift when changes are detected in local copies of your projects, such as after new project creation and project importing and the Console tab is made visible after publishing so that you can have a detailed look at what happened. Enhancements have been made to the information provided about cartridges, warnings about lack of SSH keys and impact of removing cartridges, access to credentials for Jenkins applications, port forwarding for scalable applications, and dragging and dropping projects on an OpenShift server adapter to deploy TomCat applications to OpenShift. Furthermore, OpenShift Tools supports the changes to OpenShift that enable you to use use MySQL and Postgres databases simultaneously.</para></listitem>
