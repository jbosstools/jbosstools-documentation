== Overview of JBoss Central and the JBoss Perspective

[[about-jboss-central]]
=== About JBoss Central


JBoss Central is a core IDE view, providing access to JBoss information and assistance in one centralized location.
It offers features for first time users of JBoss Tools, as well as those with more experience.



JBoss Central comprises resources and actions for creating new projects, learning about the tools and installing software updates: 


* Project wizards create new projects based on sample applications and different technologies.
* The TicketMonster tutorial, part of JBoss Java Developer Framework, demonstrates how to use the IDE to best advantage in developing a complex web application that utilizes JBoss technologies.
* Links to JBoss blog posts give timely insight into JBoss developments and the links to JBoss resources, such as documentation and forums, provide easy access to key information sources.
* Software installation and update information assist in the easy management of IDE plug-ins.


[[about-the-jboss-perspective]]
=== About the JBoss Perspective


JBoss is a key IDE perspective, giving easy access to useful views and actions when developing applications with JBoss technologies.
The perspective consists of a default set of views, menus and toolbars.



Views;;
  
  The default views of the JBoss perspective are JBoss Central, OpenShift Explorer, Outline, Package Explorer, Palette, Problems, Project Explorer, Properties, and Servers.
  These views are vital when developing with JBoss technologies.

Menus;;
  
  The default menus of the JBoss perspective are File, Edit, Navigate, Search, Project, Run, Window, Help.
  These are shared with other perspectives but contain unique menu items for actions such as starting project wizards, converting line delimiters, showing items in JBoss perspective views, generating Javadoc, building packages, accessing JBoss Central and cheat sheets, and reporting problems with tools.

Toolbars;;
  
  The default toolbars that compose the global toolbar of the JBoss perspective are BrowserSim, Debug, File, Help, Java EE, Java Element Creation, JBoss Tools WTP Server Actions, Launch, Navigate, Search, Select Maven Profiles, and Web Browser.
  The global toolbar provides access to frequently used actions.

JBoss Central provides access to wizards for generating projects.
There are two types of project wizards available in JBoss Central: `Start from scratch` and `Start from a sample`.



`Start from scratch`;;
  
  These wizards create the same project using different underlying technology, as stated in the project name.
  To view a project summary, hover the cursor over a project wizard.
  If you do not have the necessary plug-in installed to use a wizard, you are prompted to install it when you click the wizard.

[[use-project-examples-when-working-offline]]
=== Use Project Examples when Working Offline


When a project wizard in JBoss Central is used, the IDE searches online repositories for the most recent versions of project dependencies.
JBoss Central enables you to create a cache of the necessary project dependencies when you are online so that you can still use the project wizards offline.
As detailed below, this is achieved by first creating the cache and then informing the IDE to use that cache.


IMPORTANT: 
Groovy must be installed and configured as stated in the Groovy documentation.
For more information, see http://groovy.codehaus.org/Installing+Groovy[] at the Groovy website.


IMPORTANT: 
Maven must be correctly configured for all of the project wizards before the cache script is run.
The JBoss Public Maven repository must be specified in [file]`settings.xml`.



To create the cache, click `Window`&rarr;`Preferences`.
Expand `JBoss Tools`&rarr;`Project Examples` and select `Offline Support`.
To run the cache generating script, click `Copy to Clipboard` and paste the selected text on a command line outside the IDE. The script downloads and builds all of the project examples in a new directory [file]`offline`.
The script may take some time to complete.



Once the cache is generated, copy [file]`offline/.jbosstools/cache` to the directory where you want to keep the project examples cache.
Copy the contents of [file]`offline/.m2/repository` to your local maven repository.



To inform the IDE to use the generated project examples cache, click `Window`&rarr;`Preferences`.
Expand `JBoss Tools`&rarr;`Project Examples` and select `Offline Support`.
Select the `Enable offline mode for project examples` check box.
Ensure the correct cache location is specified in the `Offline directory` field.
Click `Apply` and click `OK` to close the `Preferences` window.


.Offline Mode Enabled for JBoss Central Project Examples
image::images/4271.png["To inform the IDE to use the generated project examples cache, click WindowPreferences. Expand JBoss ToolsProject Examples and select Offline Support.

Click Apply and click OK to close the Preferences window."]
[[install-software-when-working-offline]]
=== Install Software when Working Offline


You can install the JBoss and third-party plug-ins listed in JBoss Central in offline mode using the JBoss Central [file]`.zip` file, as detailed below.
This feature is useful if you regularly work offline or if you are installing these auxiliary plug-ins in a number of JBoss&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Studio installations as it removes the need to repeatedly download the same plug-ins.



Note that the JBoss Central [file]`.zip` file is a snapshot of the plug-ins at the time of the given JBoss&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Studio release and updated versions of the plug-ins must be installed from JBoss Central in online mode.



NOTE: 
To install JBoss and third-party plug-ins in offline mode, you must first download the JBoss Central [file]`.zip` file.
You can download the JBoss Central [file]`.zip` file from http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/targetplatforms/jbtcentraltarget/[] on the JBoss Tools website.

* Click `Help`&rarr;`Install New Software`.
* In the `Work with` field, enter the path of the JBoss Central [file]`.zip` file.
  Alternatively, click `Add` and click `Archive` to locate the file.
* Clear the `Group items by category` check box.
  This action makes the contents of the JBoss Central [file]`.zip` file visible in the table of components.
* From the table of components, select the software to be installed and click `Next`.
* Review the details of the items listed for install and click `Next`.
* After reading and agreeing to the license(s), click `I accept the terms of the license agreement(s)` and click `Finish`.
  The `Installing Software` window opens and reports the progress of the installation.
* During the installation process you may receive warnings about installing unsigned content.
  If this is the case, review the details of the content and if satisfied click `OK` to continue with the installation.
* Once installing is complete, you are prompted to restart the IDE. Click `Yes` to restart now and `No` if you need to save any unsaved changes to open projects.
  Note that changes do not take effect until the IDE is restarted.

[[set-cheat-sheet-behavior]]
=== Set Cheat Sheet Behavior


You can specify the default action the IDE is to take when finding cheat sheets in projects that it is importing.
The available options include always or never showing cheat sheets or the IDE prompting for which action to take for each import.



To customize the action, click `Window`&rarr;`Preferences`.
Expand `JBoss Tools` and select `Project Examples`.
From the `Show included cheat sheet(s) when importing a project` list, click one of the options.
Click `Apply` and click `OK` to close the window.
