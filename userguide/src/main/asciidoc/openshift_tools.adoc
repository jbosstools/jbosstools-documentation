[[about-openshift]]
=== About OpenShift


OpenShift is Red Hat's Platform as a Service (PaaS) for applications.
It consists of an application platform in the cloud, enabling you to build, test and run applications in a cloud architecture.
OpenShift provides disk space, CPU resources, network connectivity, and a runtime environment.



OpenShift is available in three versions: OpenShift Online, Enterprise and Origin.
OpenShift Online is the public cloud offering, with free and paid plans, hosted at https://openshift.redhat.com[].
OpenShift Enterprise is the private cloud offering, obtained through a Red Hat OpenShift subscription and hosted in a private data center.
OpenShift Origin is the community and local cloud offering, available to download and install locally for development and testing purposes.



OpenShift has a number of key features to assist you in developing and deploying applications: 


* Unique domain names, or namespaces, support the hosting of your applications.
  A user account provides you with access to domains, the latter having the potential to be associated with multiple applications.
* Numerous cartridges give you access to predefined build and runtime environments with popular languages, database and management frameworks.
  OpenShift can also be extensively customized with the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) cartridge.
* Different sized gears provide RAM and disk space for your applications and cartridges.
  You can use a set number of small gears as part of OpenShift Online with Free Plan, a free OpenShift user account, and extend to more gears and bigger gears with OpenShift Online with Silver Plan or OpenShift Enterprise.
* Built-in administrative and stack management frees you up to focus on code development.
  OpenShift manages the intricate details of deploying your application to the stack and interfacing with middleware technologies for you.
* Automatic or manual scaling of the resources supporting your applications ensures that application performance does not suffer as usage increases.
  OpenShift can create additional instances of your application across more gears and enable clustering.



OpenShift can be accessed via the web interface at https://www.openshift.com/[] on the OpenShift website or via the OpenShift command line interface.

[[deploy-a-new-or-existing-application-on-openshift]]
=== Deploy a New or Existing Application on OpenShift


OpenShift Tools provides the `OpenShift Application` wizard to assist you in creating and deploying OpenShift applications.



As detailed in the procedure below, OpenShift applications can be created using three sources: an existing workspace project, a Git source or a default project template.
For an existing workspace project, the wizard merges the existing project contents with the key metadata files from a new OpenShift application so that the application can be deployed on OpenShift.
For a Git source, the wizard uses the source as the new OpenShift application so the source must be OpenShift-enabled, namely have a [file]`.openshift` directory and have the openshift profile specified in the [file]`pom.xml`.
For a project template, the templates are provided by OpenShift.



In addition to deploying your OpenShift applications, the wizard assists you in setting up linked remote (OpenShift server) and local Git repositories containing the original and clone of your project, respectively.
You can then push project changes to OpenShift via Git or allow the OpenShift server adapter to do it for you.


IMPORTANT: 
You must have SSH keys set up first in order to successfully proceed with the `OpenShift Application` wizard.


* In the `OpenShift Explorer` view, right-click the connection or domain and click `New`&rarr;`Application`.
  Alternatively, in JBoss Central click `OpenShift Application`, after which you are prompted to select an OpenShift connection and provide your user authentication information.
+

=== Customizing Overview


The aim of this section is to guide you in customizing OpenShift Tools:


* Specify the timeout behavior for OpenShift requests

=== Change the Timeout Behavior of OpenShift Requests


You may find that some requests made to OpenShift require a long time to complete and do not finish within the IDE default timeout limit of 120 seconds.
For example, some of the OpenShift quickstarts take a long time to checkout the associated large source code.
To resolve the timeout restriction, you can modify the default timeout limit to meet your requirements.



To modify the timeout limit, click `Window`&rarr;`Preferences`, expand `JBoss Tools` and select `OpenShift`.
In the `Remote requests timeout` field, type the required timeout limit in seconds.
Click `Apply` and click `OK` to close the `Preferences` window.
