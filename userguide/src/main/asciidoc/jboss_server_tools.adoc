=== About JBoss Server Tools


JBoss Server Tools is tooling for working with application servers in the IDE. It extends and enhances the existing server functionality of the IDE.



JBoss Server Tools consists of wizards, editors and actions that enable you to define, configure and manage application servers.



Runtime detection is available to assist you in locating installed application servers and integrating them into the IDE ready for use.
Additionally, you can define remote servers for []##JBoss community application servers## in the enhanced New Server wizard, which integrates with the IDE Remote System Explorer (RSE) tool.[]##JBoss Server Tools also allows you to download JBoss community application servers from within the IDE.##



Extensions to the standard IDE New Server wizard and Server Editor allow you to specify and customize more management and behavior settings for servers.
Settings include IDE interaction with servers such as launching, communicating and publishing.
The JBoss Server Editor supports you to manage server settings for global and individual application deployment.



JBoss Server Tools actions enable you to make customizations based on application server type, such as default filesets added to new servers and classpath filesets.
You can also customize the default server used for IDE actions such as 'Run on Server'.


[[about-ide-server-definitions]]
=== About IDE Server Definitions


A server definition is a description of how the IDE is to use an application server.
It informs the IDE of configuration information with which to start, communicate and manage an application server, including application deployment.
As such, a server definition is an essential element for working with an application server in the IDE.



A complete server definition is composed of two items, as listed here.



Server runtime environment;;
  
  This informs the IDE about available local application servers.
  Each server runtime environment defines a specific application server configuration in terms of the application server itself, a configuration file and a Java developer kit.
  By varying the configuration details, one application server can be associated with several server runtime environments.

Server adapter;;
  
  This informs the IDE about management settings for server runtime environments.
  Each server adapter, also referred to as simply a server, completes the definition for a specific server by detailing settings such as access parameters, launch arguments, and publishing options.
  By varying the configuration details, one server runtime environment can have several server adapters associated with it.


You must generate at least one complete server definition for an application server before you can use it in the IDE. To assist you with this, JBoss Server Tools provides runtime detection that automatically generates a complete default server definition for any installed application servers found in a given local system search path.

[[sect-features-of-jboss-server-tools]]
== Features of JBoss Server Tools

[[features-overview1]]
=== Features Overview


The aim of this section is to guide you in using JBoss Server Tools:


* Download JBoss community application servers from with the IDE
* Use runtime detection to locate installed application servers and generate complete server definitions, making them ready for IDE use
* Define custom configured servers, both local and remote, by creating additional runtime environments and server adapters
* Manage server configuration and specify IDE-server interaction with the JBoss Server Editor, including settings such as launch options, publishing frequency and communication ports

[[download-a-jboss-community-application-server]]
=== Download a JBoss Community Application Server


Application servers must be installed on your system in order to deploy applications to local and remote instances of them.
Many application servers must be downloaded from outside the IDE. But JBoss Server Tools can assist you to download JBoss community application servers from within the IDE, as detailed in the procedure below.

Once downloading is complete, the application server archive is extracted and several automated actions occur:


* The path of the application server is added to the runtime detection `Paths` table.
* A default server runtime environment is generated for the application server.
* A default server adapter is created for the server runtime environment.

NOTE: 
Alternatively, you can download and install JBoss community application servers when adding server runtime environments within `Preferences` under `Server`&rarr;`Runtime Environments`, with the wizard for creating new servers, or with the `Start from scratch` and `Start from a sample` wizards in JBoss Central.


[[create-a-default-local-server-definition-with-runtime-detection]]
=== Create a Default Local Server Definition with Runtime Detection


Before the IDE can use an application sever, you must create a server definition for it.
JBoss Server Tools provides runtime detection that automatically generates a complete default server definition for any installed application servers found in a given local system search path, as detailed in the procedure below.
[]##Note that complete server definitions are also automatically generated for JBoss community servers downloaded with JBoss Server Tools.##


[]
* Click `Window`&rarr;`Preferences`, expand `JBoss Tools` and select `JBoss Runtime Detection`.

NOTE: 
Alternatively, you can manually define servers by using the IDE server functions to create a server runtime environment and then to create a server adapter.


[[create-an-additional-server-runtime-environment]]
=== Create an Additional Server Runtime Environment


Runtime detection creates a server runtime environment as part of the default server definition for each application server it discovers in given search paths on your system.
But you may want to create additional server runtime environments that specify a variety of JREs or configuration files for a given installed application server.
The procedure below details the process for creating new server runtime environments.
For older versions of application servers, you can also create a new runtime server by cloning an existing one as explained below.


[]
* Click `Window`&rarr;`Preferences`, expand `Server` and select `Runtime Environments`.
+
.Runtime Environments Pane
image::images/4288.png["Click WindowPreferences, expand Server and select Runtime Environments."]
* Click `Add`.

NOTE: 
Alternatively, you can create server runtime environments with the wizard for creating new servers in the `Servers` view or with the `Start from scratch` and `Start from a sample` wizards in `JBoss Central`.


[[define-an-additional-local-server]]
=== Define an Additional Local Server


Runtime detection defines a local server as part of the default server definition for each application server it discovers in given search paths on your system.
But you may want to create additional server adapters that have different configurations for a given server runtime environment in order to define multiple servers.
To create a new server adapter to define a local server, you must use the new server wizard as detailed in the procedure below.


[]
* Click the `Servers` view.
  If the `Servers` view is not visible, click `Window`&rarr;`Show View`&rarr;`Servers`.
* Depending on the number of existing servers, follow the appropriate step:
+
* Complete the fields and options as detailed:
+
* From the `Select the server type` list, select a []##JBoss community application server##.
* The `Server's host name` and `Server name` fields are completed by default.
  In the `Server name` field, you can type a custom name by which to identify the server in the `Servers` view.
* From the `Server runtime environment` list, select an existing server runtime environment for the application server type.
  Alternatively, to create a new runtime environment click `Add` and complete the fields and options as appropriate.
+
.Server Runtime Environment Options in the New Server Runtime Environment Wizard

Alternatively, to create a new runtime environment click Add and complete the fields and options as appropriate."]
NOTE: +
If the `Server runtime environment` field is not shown, no server runtime environments exist for the selected application server type.
A server runtime environment must be selected before you can successfully create a server adapter and complete the server definition.
To create a new server runtime environment without canceling the wizard, click `Next` and complete the fields and options as appropriate.



* Click `Next`.

The server behavior options displayed vary depending on the selected application server type.
Complete the fields and options as detailed: 


* To specify that the server life cycle will be managed from outside the IDE, select the `Server is externally managed` check box.
* To specify that the server should be launched to respond to requests on all hostnames, select the `Listen on all interfaces to allow remote web connections` check box.
  This option adds the `-b 0.0.0.0` argument to the server launch command.
* From the location list, select `Local`.


* NOTE: 
  The `Expose your management port as the server's hostname` option, which enables management commands sent by the IDE to be successfully received by the server, is bypassed for local servers regardless of whether the check box is selected.
+

* Click `Finish` to create the server.
  The server is listed in the `Servers` view, with the information in brackets detailing the server status.

IMPORTANT: 
You can create multiple servers that use the same application server.
But a warning is displayed if you try to simultaneously run more than one server on the same host.
This is because multiple running servers on the same host can result in port conflicts.


[[define-a-remote-server]]
=== Define a Remote Server


You can define remote servers for []##JBoss community application servers##.
To complete a server definition, you must create a server adapter, or server, that informs the IDE how to communicate and manage the remote server, as detailed in the procedure below.


IMPORTANT: 
A complete server definition requires a server runtime environment and a server adapter.
Ideally the server runtime environment would be created by specifying the remote application server and remote Java developer kit but server runtime environments can only be created using local components.
To work around this issue, you must have a version of the remote application server and remote Java developer kit installed locally and create a server runtime environment based on these.


[]
* Click the `Servers` view.
  If the `Servers` view is not visible, click `Window`&rarr;`Show View`&rarr;`Servers`.
* Depending on the number of existing servers, follow the appropriate step:
+
* Complete the fields and options as detailed:
+
* From the `Select the server type` list, select a []##JBoss community application server##.
* The `Server's host name` and `Server name` fields are completed by default.
  In the `Server name` field, you can type a custom name by which to identify the server in the `Servers` view.
* From the `Server runtime environment` list, select an existing server runtime environment for the application server type.
  Alternatively, to create a new runtime environment click `Add` and complete the fields and options as appropriate.

[[sect-manage-server-settings]]
=== Manage Server Settings


JBoss Server Tools provides the JBoss Server Editor for managing the settings of servers.
This editor has two tabs: Overview and Deployment.
As described below, each tab enables you to configure fundamental server settings.



The `Overview` tab details the settings for the server.
Within this tab you can provide management information, specify application publishing and reload behavior, and customize port settings.


.Overview Tab of the JBoss Server Editor
image::images/4036.png["The Overview tab details the settings for the server. Within this tab you can provide management information, specify application publishing and reload behavior, and customize port settings."]

The `Deployment` tab lists applications deployed to the server.
Within this tab you can specify the general publishing behavior for applications and provide deployment settings for individual applications.


.Deployment Tab of the JBoss Server Editor
image::images/4056.png["The Deployment tab lists applications deployed to the server. Within this tab you can specify the general publishing behavior for applications and provide deployment settings for individual applications."]

To open the JBoss Server Editor for a specific server, in the `Servers` view double-click the server.
All changes to the settings of a server must be saved before the results will take effect.
To save changes made to server settings in the JBoss Server Editor, press `Ctrl+S`.
You may be required to enter the server management password when making changes to certain settings.


[[manage-server-settings-in-the-overview-tab]]
==== Manage Server Settings in the Overview Tab


The Overview tab of the JBoss Server Editor enables you to vary the management and behavior settings of an individual server.
Each section of the Overview tab is outlined below.
All changes to server settings must be saved before the results will take effect.
To save, press `Ctrl+S`.



General information;;
  
  This section details essential information comprising the server definition: the name by which the server is identified in the IDE, the hostname of the server and the server runtime environment.

Management login credentials;;
  
  This section holds credentials, specifically username and password, necessary for the IDE to successfully communicate management commands with the server.
  The password is obscured and stored in Eclipse Secure Storage for security.
  Incorrect management credentials can cause the IDE to not detect when a server is started.

Server behavior;;
  
  This section enables you to customize server behavior that encompasses how the IDE communicates with the server.

Publishing;;
  
  This section details the publishing action the IDE should take in response to modifications to local resources of deployed applications.
  Publishing involves replacing changed project resources in the dedicated deployment location of a server and the IDE action options are `Never publish automatically`, `Automatically publish when resources change`, and `Automatically publish after a build event`.
  Additionally, you can specify a minimum time interval that must occur between consecutive automated publish actions by the IDE to control the frequency of publishing.

Timeouts;;
  
  This section specifies the maximum length of time, in seconds, the IDE should wait for server actions to complete before aborting.
  The server actions are specifically starting and stopping.

Deployment scanner;;
  
  This section enables you to customize the behavior of deployment scanners, which detect the applications deployed to a server.
  You can manage deployment scanners or allow the IDE to do it for you.
  The management options available are `Add missing deployment scanners after server startup` and `Remove added deployment scanners before shutdown`.

Application reload behavior;;
  
  This section details the application reload action the IDE should take in response to changed published resources of deployed applications.
  Application reload involves undeploying and redeploying an application and this action is necessary when you make changes to project resources that will not be detected by the server.
  By default, the application reload behavior is set to invoke application redeployment when [file]`.jar` files are changed.

Server state detectors;;
  
  This section specifies which method the IDE should use to verify the started and stopped status of the server.

Server ports;;
  
  This section details the ports and port offset that the IDE should use for communication with the server.

[[manage-server-settings-in-the-deployment-tab]]
==== Manage Server Settings in the Deployment Tab


The Deployment tab of the JBoss Server Editor enables you to vary the deployment settings of an individual server.
Each section of the Deployment tab is outlined below.
All changes to server settings must be saved before the results will take effect.
To save, press `Ctrl+S`.


IMPORTANT: 
Changing deployment settings when modules are already deployed can adversely result in multiple deployed copies of an application.
For this reason, many of the functions of the Deployment tab are only enabled when a server is fully synchronized and it has no modules deployed.



Default settings for the server;;
  
  This section specifies where deployments are kept and how they are packaged.

Settings per module;;
  
  This section shows deployment settings for all modules in the workspace regardless of whether they are deployed on the server under consideration.

[[sect-customizing-jboss-server-tools]]
