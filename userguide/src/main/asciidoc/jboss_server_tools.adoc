=== About JBoss Server Tools


JBoss Server Tools is tooling for working with application servers in the IDE. It extends and enhances the existing server functionality of the IDE.



JBoss Server Tools consists of wizards, editors and actions that enable you to define, configure and manage application servers.



Runtime detection is available to assist you in locating installed application servers and integrating them into the IDE ready for use.
Additionally, you can define remote servers for JBoss community application servers in the enhanced New Server wizard, which integrates with the IDE Remote System Explorer (RSE) tool.JBoss Server Tools also allows you to download JBoss community application servers from within the IDE.



Extensions to the standard IDE New Server wizard and Server Editor allow you to specify and customize more management and behavior settings for servers.
Settings include IDE interaction with servers such as launching, communicating and publishing.
The JBoss Server Editor supports you to manage server settings for global and individual application deployment.



JBoss Server Tools actions enable you to make customizations based on application server type, such as default filesets added to new servers and classpath filesets.
You can also customize the default server used for IDE actions such as 'Run on Server'.


[[about-ide-server-definitions]]
=== About IDE Server Definitions


A server definition is a description of how the IDE is to use an application server.
It informs the IDE of configuration information with which to start, communicate and manage an application server, including application deployment.
As such, a server definition is an essential element for working with an application server in the IDE.



A complete server definition is composed of two items, as listed here.



Server runtime environment;;
  
  This informs the IDE about available local application servers.
  Each server runtime environment defines a specific application server configuration in terms of the application server itself, a configuration file and a Java developer kit.
  By varying the configuration details, one application server can be associated with several server runtime environments.

Server adapter;;
  
  This informs the IDE about management settings for server runtime environments.
  Each server adapter, also referred to as simply a server, completes the definition for a specific server by detailing settings such as access parameters, launch arguments, and publishing options.
  By varying the configuration details, one server runtime environment can have several server adapters associated with it.


You must generate at least one complete server definition for an application server before you can use it in the IDE. To assist you with this, JBoss Server Tools provides runtime detection that automatically generates a complete default server definition for any installed application servers found in a given local system search path.

[[sect-features-of-jboss-server-tools]]
== Features of JBoss Server Tools

[[features-overview1]]
=== Features Overview


The aim of this section is to guide you in using JBoss Server Tools:


* Download JBoss community application servers from with the IDE
* Use runtime detection to locate installed application servers and generate complete server definitions, making them ready for IDE use
* Define custom configured servers, both local and remote, by creating additional runtime environments and server adapters
* Manage server configuration and specify IDE-server interaction with the JBoss Server Editor, including settings such as launch options, publishing frequency and communication ports

[[download-a-jboss-community-application-server]]
=== Download a JBoss Community Application Server


Application servers must be installed on your system in order to deploy applications to local and remote instances of them.
Many application servers must be downloaded from outside the IDE. But JBoss Server Tools can assist you to download JBoss community application servers from within the IDE, as detailed in the procedure below.

.Procedure: Download a JBoss Community Application Server


. Click `Window`&rarr;`Preferences`, expand `JBoss Tools` and select `JBoss Runtime Detection`.

[[create-a-default-local-server-definition-with-runtime-detection]]
=== Create a Default Local Server Definition with Runtime Detection


Before the IDE can use an application sever, you must create a server definition for it.
JBoss Server Tools provides runtime detection that automatically generates a complete default server definition for any installed application servers found in a given local system search path, as detailed in the procedure below.
Note that complete server definitions are also automatically generated for JBoss community servers downloaded with JBoss Server Tools.

.Procedure: Define a Local Server with Runtime Detection


. Click `Window`&rarr;`Preferences`, expand `JBoss Tools` and select `JBoss Runtime Detection`.

[NOTE]
====

Alternatively, you can manually define servers by using the IDE server functions to create a server runtime environment and then to create a server adapter.

====

[[create-an-additional-server-runtime-environment]]
=== Create an Additional Server Runtime Environment


Runtime detection creates a server runtime environment as part of the default server definition for each application server it discovers in given search paths on your system.
But you may want to create additional server runtime environments that specify a variety of JREs or configuration files for a given installed application server.
The procedure below details the process for creating new server runtime environments.
For older versions of application servers, you can also create a new runtime server by cloning an existing one as explained below.

.Procedure: Create a Server Runtime Environment


. Click `Window`&rarr;`Preferences`, expand `Server` and select `Runtime Environments`.
+
.Runtime Environments Pane
image::images/4288.png["Click WindowPreferences, expand Server and select Runtime Environments."]

====

[[define-an-additional-local-server]]
=== Define an Additional Local Server


Runtime detection defines a local server as part of the default server definition for each application server it discovers in given search paths on your system.
But you may want to create additional server adapters that have different configurations for a given server runtime environment in order to define multiple servers.
To create a new server adapter to define a local server, you must use the new server wizard as detailed in the procedure below.

.Procedure: Define a Local Server


. Click the `Servers` view.
  If the `Servers` view is not visible, click `Window`&rarr;`Show View`&rarr;`Servers`.
. Depending on the number of existing servers, follow the appropriate step:
+
a. If there are no existing servers, click `Click this link to create a new server`.
a. If there are one or more existing servers, right-click an existing server and click `New`&rarr;`Server`.

. Complete the fields and options as detailed:
+
* From the `Select the server type` list, select a JBoss community application server.
* The `Server's host name` and `Server name` fields are completed by default.
  In the `Server name` field, you can type a custom name by which to identify the server in the `Servers` view.
* From the `Server runtime environment` list, select an existing server runtime environment for the application server type.
  Alternatively, to create a new runtime environment click `Add` and complete the fields and options as appropriate.
+

Alternatively, to create a new runtime environment click Add and complete the fields and options as appropriate."]
+
[NOTE]
====

If the `Server runtime environment` field is not shown, no server runtime environments exist for the selected application server type.
A server runtime environment must be selected before you can successfully create a server adapter and complete the server definition.
To create a new server runtime environment without canceling the wizard, click `Next` and complete the fields and options as appropriate.

====


. Click `Next`.

. The server behavior options displayed vary depending on the selected application server type.
Complete the fields and options as detailed:
* To specify that the server life cycle will be managed from outside the IDE, select the `Server is externally managed` check box.
* To specify that the server should be launched to respond to requests on all hostnames, select the `Listen on all interfaces to allow remote web connections` check box.
  This option adds the `-b 0.0.0.0` argument to the server launch command.
* From the location list, select `Local`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `Expose your management port as the server's hostname` option, which enables management commands sent by the IDE to be successfully received by the server, is bypassed for local servers regardless of whether the check box is selected.

. Click `Finish` to create the server.
  The server is listed in the `Servers` view, with the information in brackets detailing the server status.

[IMPORTANT]
====

You can create multiple servers that use the same application server.
But a warning is displayed if you try to simultaneously run more than one server on the same host.
This is because multiple running servers on the same host can result in port conflicts.

====

[[define-a-remote-server]]
=== Define a Remote Server


You can define remote servers for JBoss community application servers.
To complete a server definition, you must create a server adapter, or server, that informs the IDE how to communicate and manage the remote server, as detailed in the procedure below.


[IMPORTANT]
====

A complete server definition requires a server runtime environment and a server adapter.
Ideally the server runtime environment would be created by specifying the remote application server and remote Java developer kit but server runtime environments can only be created using local components.
To work around this issue, you must have a version of the remote application server and remote Java developer kit installed locally and create a server runtime environment based on these.

====
.Procedure: Define a Remote Server


. Click the `Servers` view.
  If the `Servers` view is not visible, click `Window`&rarr;`Show View`&rarr;`Servers`.
. Depending on the number of existing servers, follow the appropriate step:
+
a. If there are no existing servers, click `Click this link to create a new server`.
a. If there are one or more existing servers, right-click an existing server and click `New`&rarr;`Server`.

. Complete the fields and options as detailed:
+
* From the `Select the server type` list, select a JBoss community application server.

=== Default Classpath Entries


Classpath entries specify the availability of `.jar` files for your projects.
JBoss Server Tools generates a default classpath file set for new JBoss community application servers based on the `.jar` files that accompany each.
But JBoss Server Tools also provides the ability for you to customize classpaths for individual servers and application server types.



To customize the classpath file set for an application server type, click `Window`&rarr;`Preferences`.
Expand `Server`&rarr;`Runtime Environments` and select `Default Classpath Entries`.
From the `Select classpath filesets for this runtime type` list, select a JBoss community application server type.
Click `Add` or click `Remove` to customize the classpath file sets.
Click `Apply` and click `OK` to close the `Preferences` window.
