=== About LiveReload

LiveReload is an open source tool that refreshes web pages open in
browsers as their source is edited. Immediate and automatic web page
refreshing, without the need to manually refresh, assists to simplify
the workflow of web developers.

LiveReload consists of server-side and client-side components. The
server-side application monitors the source and sends notifications as
the source is changed. On the client-side, a JavaScript snippet receives
the notifications and invokes the browser to refresh the web page. The
server-side and client-side components communicate using the WebSocket
protocol, which allows the server-side application to send notifications
to the client-side JavaScript snippet.

The JavaScript snippet can be installed and activated using a LiveReload
browser extension. Alternatively, it can be inserted manually in the
HTML pages. Depending upon the changes to the source, the web page is
either reloaded or the browser updated instantly without reloading.

The LiveReload application is available for OS X and Microsoft Window
operating systems and through a third-party provider for Linux-based
operating systems. LiveReload browser extensions are available for
Safari, Chrome and Firefox.

=== About LiveReload Tools

LiveReload Tools is tooling that implements LiveReload in the IDE. It
enables you to take advantage of LiveReload browser refreshing while
editing files within the IDE. The capabilities of LiveReload Tools also
remove the need to install the LiveReload standalone application or
browser extensions.

LiveReload Tools is the implementation of the LiveReload server-side
component, which listens to the IDE for resource changes and sends
notifications for refreshes as appropriate. The server can also be
configured to inject the livereload.js JavaScript snippet into the
source code, which removes the need to install LiveReload browser
extensions.

Unique features of LiveReload tools include LiveReload for both
workspace and deployed resources due to the use of HTTP protocol for all
resources and LiveReload on external devices with access and ease of use
for remote connections to LiveReload servers. The LiveReload server can
also be used in conjunction with BrowserSim, extending LiveReload to
simulated devices.

[[features-overview]]
=== Features Overview

The aim of this section is to guide you in using LiveReload Tools:

* Create a LiveReload server to receive information from the IDE on
resource changes
* Configure LiveReload for use with system web browsers and external
devices
* View resources in LiveReload-enabled web browsers, including system
and external device browsers and BrowserSim

[[create-a-livereload-server]]
=== Create a LiveReload Server

The LiveReload server is integral to the LiveReload integration with the
IDE. In its default configuration, the server receives information from
the IDE when resources change and sends notifications for refresh
actions to be taken. The server may also be further configured to inject
the necessary JavaScript code snippets into HTML files or enable remote
connections. The procedure below guides you through creating a default
LiveReload server.

1.  Click the `Servers` view. If the `Servers` view is not visible,
click `Window`→`Show View`→`Servers`.
2.  Depending on the number of existing servers, follow the appropriate
step:
+
If there are no existing servers, click
`Click this link to create a new server`.
+
If there are one or more existing servers, right-click an existing
server and click `New`→`Server`.
3.  From the list of server types, expand `Basic` and select
`LiveReload Server`.
+

select `LiveReload Server`.]
4.  The `Server's host name` and `Server name` fields are automatically
populated. The `localhost` value in the `Server's host name` field
indicates that the server is to be run on the local system and the value
in the `Server name` field is the name by which the LiveReload server is
identified in the `Servers` view. You can edit these values as
appropriate by typing in the fields.
5.  Click `Finish` to close the window. The LiveReload server is listed
in the `Servers` view.

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, LiveReload servers can be automatically created when you
select to view workspace and deployed resources in web browsers using
the actions provided by LiveReload Tools.

[[configure-the-livereload-server]]
=== Configure the LiveReload Server

A LiveReload client must be inserted into HTML files in order for it to
receive the LiveReload server notifications about changed resources.
LiveReload Tools provides additional configuration options so that the
LiveReload server can inject the necessary `<script>` element into the
HTML resources. Furthermore, the LiveReload server can be configured to
allow access from external devices, enabling LiveReload to function in
browsers of remote devices.

The details below outline how to set the configuration options using the
Server Editor. To open the Server Editor for a LiveReload server, in the
`Servers` view double-click the LiveReload server. Alternatively,
right-click the LiveReload server and click `Open` or press F3.

image:images/4078.png[The details below outline how to set the
configuration options using the Server Editor. To open the Server Editor
for a LiveReload server, in the `Servers` tab double-click the
LiveReload server. Alternatively, right-click the LiveReload server and
click `Open` or press F3.]

Insert JavaScript code snippet to resources::
In the Server Editor under `LiveReload Server Configuration`, select
the `Inject the livereload.js script in HTML pages` check box.
Enable LiveReload in external device browsers::
In the Server Editor under `LiveReload Server Configuration`, select
the `Allow Remote Connections` check box. This option is disabled by
default when a LiveReload server is created as it exposes your
workspace files, which may not always be desirable.

All changes to the settings of a LiveReload server must be saved and the
server restarted before the results will take effect. To save setting
changes, press Ctrl+S or click `File`→`Save` or click the `Save` icon.
To restart the server, in the `Servers` view right-click the LiveReload
server and click `Restart`.

[[view-resources-in-livereload-enabled-browsers]]
=== View Resources in LiveReload-enabled Browsers

You can use the actions of LiveReload Tools to open HTML, XHTML and
AsciiDoc resources in LiveReload-enabled browsers, as detailed below. If
the requisite LiveReload server does not exist or is not correctly
configured, you are prompted by LiveReload Tools, which can complete the
necessary requirements for you. Note that LiveReload Tools functionality
may only work with deployed XHTML resources due to their dynamic nature.

[NOTE]
====
To use LiveReload Tools with AsciiDoc files, you must install the
AsciiDoctor.js browser extension from
http://asciidoctor.org/news/2013/09/18/introducing-asciidoctor-js-live-preview/[]
on the Asciidoctor website. The browser extension renders AsciiDoc files
as HTML and it is available for Chrome and FireFox.

[[view-resources-in-livereload-enabled-browsersim]]
=== View Resources in LiveReload-enabled BrowserSim

The LiveReload server can be used in conjunction with BrowserSim. In
this case, the server sends notifications about changed resources and
BrowserSim inserts the JavaScript code, which invokes the simulated
device browser window to refresh. The procedure below outlines how to
enable LiveReload in BrowserSim for workspace and deployed resources.

1.  Ensure the LiveReload server is started. If it is not started, in
the `Servers` view right-click the LiveReload server and click `Start`.
2.  Complete the appropriate step depending on the location of your
resources:
+
For workspace resources, in the `Project Explorer` view right-click the
resource file and click `Open With`→`BrowserSim`.
+
For deployed resources, in the `Servers` view right-click the
application and click `Show In`→`BrowserSim`.
+
image:images/4072.png[For deployed resources, in the `Servers` view
right-click the application and click `Show In`→`BrowserSim`.]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure the server and application of the deployed resources are started
before attempting to view the resources in LiveReload-enabled
BrowserSim. To start the server and the application, in the `Servers`
view right-click each and click `Start`.
====
3.  Right-click the simulated device and ensure the `Enable LiveReload`
check box is selected.
