== Overview of Hybrid Mobile Tools and CordovaSim

[[about-apache-cordova]]
=== About Apache Cordova


Apache Cordova is a framework for hybrid mobile application development.
It simplifies mobile application development by enabling developers to use device-independent APIs, in place of native code, to access device functionality.



Cordova consists of plug-ins, each providing a wrapper API to gain access to corresponding native device APIs.
Cordova APIs are available for a range of device functionality, including cameras, accelerometers, and filesystems.
All of the Cordova APIs have a JavaScript interface and native backing code to support a variety of different device operating systems, including Android and iOS.



The JavaScript interface of Cordova APIs provides consistent methods for accessing native device functionality regardless of operating system.
Applications using Cordova are written once and packaged using native software development kits (SDKs) to produce hybrid mobile applications.



Cordova applications have a distinctive project structure: 


* An essential [file]`config.xml` file holds information about the application.
  It specifies features, preferences and access details that affect how the application works, for example whether the application responds to orientation changes.
* An application is implemented as a web page.
  The default starting page is [file]`index.html` and device-independent resources are stored in a [file]`www` directory.
* An application must reference the [file]`cordova.js` file, which holds necessary API bindings that enable the application to interact with device features.



Apache Cordova is an open source project, of which there are various distributions.
PhoneGap, in addition to being the originator of Cordova, and IBM Worklight are such distributions.


[[about-hybrid-mobile-tools]]
=== About Hybrid Mobile Tools


Hybrid Mobile Tools provides tooling for developing Cordova-based hybrid mobile applications within the IDE. It simplifies the process of getting started with the Cordova technology that can be used for these types of applications and provides workflows for developing Cordova-based hybrid mobile applications.



Hybrid Mobile Tools consists of the Apache Cordova API and wizards, a dedicated editor and actions for developing Cordova-based hybrid mobile applications for Android and iOS operating systems: 


* The Hybrid Mobile Application project wizard creates a sample project to demonstrate the Cordova project structure and provides you with a template from which to create your own applications.
* The Cordova Configuration Editor offers simplified management of [file]`config.xml` files, with dedicated tabs for adding and editing project descriptions, features, preferences and access.
  An additional tab enables direct editing of [file]`config.xml` files.
* The Cordova Plug-in Discovery wizard assists you to add Cordova plug-ins to your projects.
  Plug-ins can be installed from the Cordova registry, Git locations and system directories.
  Information displayed in the `Project Explorer` view is extended to show installed plug-ins and enable their management.
* Actions are provided for calling external Android and iOS SDKs to package Cordova-based hybrid mobile projects into native applications and subsequently run them on their associated simulators or connected Android devices.
* Export wizards are available for exporting Cordova-based hybrid mobile projects from the IDE workspace as Cordova-enabled Android or iOS projects and ready-to-sign applications.



Hybrid Mobile Tools, together with CordovaSim, provides a rounded hybrid mobile development and testing environment.


[[about-cordovasim]]
=== About CordovaSim


CordovaSim is a mobile application simulator.
It enables you to view and test Cordova-based hybrid mobile applications through a mobile device simulator.



CordovaSim consists of a device input panel based on an extended version of Apache Ripple, teamed with BrowserSim.
The input panel provides the ability to give sample input for device features to the application, such as camera, geolocation and accelerometer data.
BrowserSim displays and enables user interaction with the application.



Extensions to the device input panel for CordovaSim include the following:


* CordovaSim supports a range of Cordova API implementations: the core Apache Cordova plug-ins, several PhoneGap plug-ins and custom plug-ins.
  Supported PhoneGap plug-ins include `BarcodeScanner`, `InAppBrowser` and `ChildBrowser`.
  (Note that exceptions to the supported core Apache Cordova plug-ins are `File` and the `captureAudio` and `captureVideo` methods of `Capture`.)
* CordovaSim automatically injects an up-to-date version of the [file]`cordova.js` library into your project code at simulation time in the case that it is missing.
  Typically this file is added when a project is built with a native SDK. This response by CordovaSim enables it to simulate applications of Cordova-based hybrid mobile projects and Cordova-enabled Android projects without requiring native SDKs.
* The use of BrowserSim for displaying the application extends the functionality of the mobile application simulator to encompass all of the BrowserSim functionality.
  This functionality includes skins, screen captures and LiveReload.

[[system-requirements-for-cordovasim]]
=== System Requirements for CordovaSim


[]##The overall system requirements of JBoss Tools are applicable for CordovaSim and can be viewed at https://community.jboss.org/wiki/MatrixOfSupportedPlatformsRuntimesAndTechnologiesInJBossToolsJBDS[] on the JBoss Tools website.## But CordovaSim uses BrowserSim and, as reiterated below, there are additional system requirements and restrictions when using BrowserSim on Microsoft Windows operating systems.



BrowserSim depends on WebKit and, consequently, requires Apple Safari to be installed on Microsoft Windows operating systems.
Only a 32-bit version of Apple Safari is available for Microsoft Windows operating systems.
To work around this restriction for 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems, you must set BrowserSim to use a 32-bit JVM when running in 64-bit versions of []##Eclipse##.
Note that 32-bit JVM choice is limited to Oracle 32-bit JRE 1.6, JDK 1.6, or JDK 1.7 on Microsoft Windows operating systems because Oracle 32-bit JRE 1.7 is incompatible with Apple Safari.



If BrowserSim is already installed, it can be set to use a 32-bit JVM either before or after installing CordovaSim.
To set BrowserSim to use a 32-bit JVM, click `Window`&rarr;`Preferences`.
Expand `JBoss Tools` and select `BrowserSim/CordovaSim`.
Under `Select JRE to run BrowserSim`, click `Select` and from the list select a 32-bit JRE or Java developer kit.
Click `Apply` and click `OK` to close the `Preferences` window.
