[[about-apache-cordova]]
== About Apache Cordova

Apache Cordova is a framework for hybrid mobile application development.
It simplifies mobile application development by enabling developers to
use device-independent APIs, in place of native code, to access device
functionality.

Cordova consists of plug-ins, each providing a wrapper API to gain
access to corresponding native device APIs. Cordova APIs are available
for a range of device functionality, including cameras, accelerometers,
and filesystems. All of the Cordova APIs have a JavaScript interface and
native backing code to support a variety of different device operating
systems, including Android and iOS.

The JavaScript interface of Cordova APIs provides consistent methods for
accessing native device functionality regardless of operating system.
Applications using Cordova are written once and packaged using native
software development kits (SDKs) to produce hybrid mobile applications.

Cordova applications have a distinctive project structure:

* An essential `config.xml` file holds information about the
application. It specifies features, preferences and access details that
affect how the application works, for example whether the application
responds to orientation changes.
* An application is implemented as a web page. The default starting page
is `index.html` and device-independent resources are stored in a `www`
directory.
* An application must reference the `cordova.js` file, which holds
necessary API bindings that enable the application to interact with
device features.

Apache Cordova is an open source project, of which there are various
distributions. PhoneGap, in addition to being the originator of Cordova,
and IBM Worklight are such distributions.

[[about-hybrid-mobile-tools]]
== About Hybrid Mobile Tools

Hybrid Mobile Tools provides tooling for developing Cordova-based hybrid
mobile applications within the IDE. It simplifies the process of getting
started with the Cordova technology that can be used for these types of
applications and provides workflows for developing Cordova-based hybrid
mobile applications.

Hybrid Mobile Tools consists of the Apache Cordova API and wizards, a
dedicated editor and actions for developing Cordova-based hybrid mobile
applications for Android and iOS operating systems:

* The Hybrid Mobile Application project wizard creates a sample project
to demonstrate the Cordova project structure and provides you with a
template from which to create your own applications.
* The Cordova Configuration Editor offers simplified management of
`config.xml` files, with dedicated tabs for adding and editing project
descriptions, features, preferences and access. An additional tab
enables direct editing of `config.xml` files.
* The Cordova Plug-in Discovery wizard assists you to add Cordova
plug-ins to your projects. Plug-ins can be installed from the Cordova
registry, Git locations and system directories. Information displayed in
the `Project Explorer` view is extended to show installed plug-ins and
enable their management.
* Actions are provided for calling external Android and iOS SDKs to
package Cordova-based hybrid mobile projects into native applications
and subsequently run them on their associated simulators or connected
Android devices.
* Export wizards are available for exporting Cordova-based hybrid mobile
projects from the IDE workspace as Cordova-enabled Android or iOS
projects and ready-to-sign applications.

Hybrid Mobile Tools, together with CordovaSim, provides a rounded hybrid
mobile development and testing environment.

[[about-cordovasim]]
== About CordovaSim

CordovaSim is a mobile application simulator. It enables you to view and
test Cordova-based hybrid mobile applications through a mobile device
simulator.

CordovaSim consists of a device input panel based on an extended version
of Apache Ripple, teamed with BrowserSim. The input panel provides the
ability to give sample input for device features to the application,
such as camera, geolocation and accelerometer data. BrowserSim displays
and enables user interaction with the application.

Extensions to the device input panel for CordovaSim include the
following:

* CordovaSim supports a range of Cordova API implementations: the core
Apache Cordova plug-ins, several PhoneGap plug-ins and custom plug-ins.
Supported PhoneGap plug-ins include `BarcodeScanner`, `InAppBrowser` and
`ChildBrowser`. (Note that exceptions to the supported core Apache
Cordova plug-ins are `File` and the `captureAudio` and `captureVideo`
methods of `Capture`.)
* CordovaSim automatically injects an up-to-date version of the
`cordova.js` library into your project code at simulation time in the
case that it is missing. Typically this file is added when a project is
built with a native SDK. This response by CordovaSim enables it to
simulate applications of Cordova-based hybrid mobile projects and
Cordova-enabled Android projects without requiring native SDKs.
* The use of BrowserSim for displaying the application extends the
functionality of the mobile application simulator to encompass all of
the BrowserSim functionality. This functionality includes skins, screen
captures and LiveReload.

[[system-requirements-for-hybrid-mobile-tools]]
== System Requirements for Hybrid Mobile Tools

The overall system requirements of JBoss Tools are applicable for Hybrid
Mobile Tools and can be viewed at
https://community.jboss.org/wiki/MatrixOfSupportedPlatformsRuntimesAndTechnologiesInJBossToolsJBDS[]
on the JBoss Tools website. But, as reiterated below, there are
additional system requirements and restrictions when using Hybrid Mobile
Tools.

Hybrid Mobile Tools actions involving Android and iOS require the
associated SDKs to be installed on your system.

[NOTE]
====
CordovaSim is a standalone simulator for mobile device operating
systems, including Android and iOS. It does not require native SDKs to
be installed in order to simulate successfully.
====

Android SDK (including emulator)::
This is available as part of Android Development Tools. For further
information see http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html[] on the
Android Developers website. Note that for Android actions in Hybrid
Mobile Tools it is only necessary to install the Android SDK, which
includes the Android Emulator.
+
Once downloaded, you must use the included Android SDK Manager to
further download necessary APIs and set up Android virtual devices
(AVDs).
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must have Android API 17 or later installed on your system to use
the Hybrid Mobile Tools `Run on Android Emulator` action. You are
prompted by an error message when only Android API 16 or earlier is
available. In the event that multiple Android API of 17 and later are
available, Hybrid Mobile Tools uses the latest version.
====
+
Further, once Hybrid Mobile Tools is installed, you must set the
Android SDK location in the IDE before you can use Hybrid Mobile Tools
actions involving Android.
iOS SDK (including simulator)::
This is available as part of Apple XCode. For further information see

[[system-requirements-for-cordovasim]]
== System Requirements for CordovaSim

The overall system requirements of JBoss Tools are applicable for
CordovaSim and can be viewed at
https://community.jboss.org/wiki/MatrixOfSupportedPlatformsRuntimesAndTechnologiesInJBossToolsJBDS[]
on the JBoss Tools website. But CordovaSim uses BrowserSim and, as
reiterated below, there are additional system requirements and
restrictions when using BrowserSim on Microsoft Windows operating
systems.

BrowserSim depends on WebKit and, consequently, requires Apple Safari to
be installed on Microsoft Windows operating systems. Only a 32-bit
version of Apple Safari is available for Microsoft Windows operating
systems. To work around this restriction for 64-bit Microsoft Windows
operating systems, you must set BrowserSim to use a 32-bit JVM when
running in 64-bit versions of Eclipse. Note that 32-bit JVM choice is
limited to Oracle 32-bit JRE 1.6, JDK 1.6, or JDK 1.7 on Microsoft
Windows operating systems because Oracle 32-bit JRE 1.7 is incompatible
with Apple Safari.

If BrowserSim is already installed, it can be set to use a 32-bit JVM
either before or after installing CordovaSim. To set BrowserSim to use a
32-bit JVM, click `Window`→`Preferences`. Expand `JBoss Tools` and
select `BrowserSim/CordovaSim`. Under `Select JRE to run BrowserSim`,
click `Select` and from the list select a 32-bit JRE or Java developer
kit. Click `Apply` and click `OK` to close the Preferences window.
